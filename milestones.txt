A. Project Definition
	1. Organization and Collaboration Tools (Slack, Trello, GitHub, Zoom) {Team,11/18/2020}
	2. GitHub: https://github.com/fk652/Big_Data_Project-Fall_2020 {Team,11/18/2020}
	3. Goals: Analyze the impact of COVID-19 on S&P 500 companies on an aggregate, sectoral and individual basis 
	to understand the varied impact of the pandemic and inform public policy {Team,11/18/2020}
B. Data Sources, Hypothesis
	1. Identified data sources {Team,11/18/2020}
		https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/ #Stock market data we will primarily use
		https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 #COVID-19 data repository John Hopkins University
		https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker #Government response index by country from Oxford University 
	2. Identified previous work and references {Nathalie, 11/18/2020}
	3. Developed preliminary list of questions and analyses {Nathalie, 11/21/2020}
C. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (OpenRefine, Jupyter Notebook, Notes, Spark)
	1. Scraping S&P 500 Wikipedia information and pulling historical data from Yahoo Finance {Fahim, 11/18/2020}
	2. Formatting stock data and calculating daily returns and daily log returns {Fahim, 11/20/2020}
	3. Cleaned and formatted Oxford Covid Data {Fahim 11/24/2020}
		- Fixed date format and decimal precisions
	4. Cleaned and joined John Hopkins datasets {Nathalie, 11/26/2020}
		- Combined two files: time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv and time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv
		- Dropped unnecessary variables like latitude and longitude
		- Transposed data (i.e. from dates in columns to dates in rows)
		- Formatted dates (from 1/1/20 to 2020-01-01)
		- Filtered US data to extract US aggregate output
	5. Pulling and cleaning news headlines per day {Parth, 11/26/2020}
		- Used NewsAPI to pull news headlines from sources such as USA Today, Wall Street Journal, FOX and Google News 
		- Used RapidAPI's COVID-19 API to get all articles related to COVID-19 from a variety of sources based on time frame
		- Extracted CNN news data from November 2019-2020
		- Removed unnecessary and redudant variables
		- Formatted all sources into (date,headline,source)
		- Combine all news into single file
D. Data Exploration & Transformation (Spark MapReduce Python)
	1. Calculated Oxford data information {Fahim 11/26/2020}
		- Indexes percent change
		- Indexes log change
	2. Calculated Stock data information {Fahim 11/28/2020}
		- total log return sums
		- cumulative log return sums
		- top and bottom companies/sectors by total sum
		- top 5 gains per company/sector/aggregate
		- top 5 drops per company/sector/aggregate
	3. Augmented John Hopkins data {Nathalie, 11/26/2020}
		- Percent change for confirmed cases and deaths (US and Worldwide)
		- Aggregated all countries data to create Worldwide output file
	4. Reformat and Filter News Data {Parth, 11/30/2020}
		- Use spark.filter to find all instances of headlines with the keywords "COVID", "coronavirus", "stock", "market"
		- Reduce by key date and have each date with all the news for that day
	5. Joined Datasets {Fahim 12/5/2020}
		- S&P_500 joined with news, oxford, and john-hopkins Datasets
		- S&P_500 aggregate joined with news, oxford, and john-hopkins Datasets
		- Sectoral joined with news, oxford, and john-hopkins Datasets
		- All stock calculation jobs joined with news
	6. Joined Datasets {Nathalie 12/03/2020}
		- S&P 500 Companies joined with S&P Information (industries, sub_industries)
		- Filtering by sector in preparation for sectoral Cluster analysis 
E. Data Exploration (Jupyter Notebook, Notes)
	1. Exploration of S&P Index and sectors on Jupyter Notebook to inform future analyses (e,g, top S&P gains and losses, sectors volatility, etc.) {Nathalie, 11/19/2020}
F. Data Analysis
	1. S&P Index Analysis {Nathalie, 11/26/2020}
		- Analyzed S&P 500 trend (cumulative sum of log returns) with major news
		- Identified periods of volatility (monthly statistics)
		- Identified covid-related events for 5 largest gains and 5 largest losses
		- Correlation between stock volatility and US Covid cases
		- Updated top S&P 500 gains and drops with news relevant events {Nathalie, 12/03/2020}
	2. Sectoral Analysis {Nathalie, 12/05/2020}
		- Top and bottom sectors versus S&P 500
		- Event Study - regression analysis to calculate abnormal returns on each of the 10 days (S&P 500 top gains and losses) + cumulative abnormal returns
		- Cluster analysis (kmeans) for Consumer Discretionary sector - showing heterogeneity
		- Cluster analysis (kmeans) for 4 sectors Communication Services, Technology, Health Care, Financials {Nathalie, 12/09/2020}
	3. Stock Analysis
		- OLS regression to predict S&P 500 companies log returns during covid, and compare with actual returns {Fahim, 12/9/2020}
G. Data Visualization & Knowledge Discovery {Parth}
	1. Initialize and Push React and Recharts Interface to GitHub{Parth,11/21/2020}
	2. Visualization Techniques
		- Interactive Line Graph for S&P500 Index Price with News
		- Created interactive tooltip that allows users to see specified attributes on a particular day
		- S&P Sectors Interactive Line Graph with Dropdown Filter
		- S&P Aggregate Daily Log Changes (Interactive Positive Negative Bar Chart) with News
		- S&P Aggregate Top 5 Gains and Drops (Interactive Positive Negative Bar Chart) with News
		- Created scatterplots for K-means clustering for S&P Sectors with on-hover tooltip
